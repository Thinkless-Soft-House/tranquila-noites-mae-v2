        "question": "Does it really work with very active babies?",
        "answer": "Yes! We work especially with babies considered 'difficult' or high-demand. The guide includes specific techniques for hyperactive babies, those with colic, or who have difficulty relaxing. Many mothers have reported extraordinary success precisely with babies who seemed impossible to calm."

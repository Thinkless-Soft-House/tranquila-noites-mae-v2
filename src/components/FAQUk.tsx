      question: "What age is the method suitable for?",
      answer: "The Calm Mum method is effective for babies from 0 to 24 months. We have specific techniques adapted for each age group: newborns (0-3 months), babies (4-12 months), and toddlers (13-24 months). Each stage has its own particularities and the guide covers them all in detail."
    },
    {
      question: "Does it work even with very restless babies?",
      answer: "Yes! We work especially with babies considered 'difficult' or high demand. The guide includes specific techniques for hyperactive babies, those with colic, or who have trouble relaxing. Many mums have reported extraordinary success, especially with babies who seemed impossible to settle."
    },
    {
      question: "How will I receive the material?",
      answer: "Immediately after payment confirmation, you will receive an email with the link to download the complete guide in PDF. The material is available for unlimited access, and you can download it as many times as you wish. We also send it via WhatsApp to ensure you receive it."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I access it on my phone?",
      answer: "Absolutely! The guide is optimised for reading on your phone, tablet, computer, or can be printed. We know mums need practicality, so you can consult the techniques at any time, anywhere, even during the night."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I want my money back?",
      answer: "You have 7 calendar days from purchase to request a full refund, with no questions asked. Just send an email to our support and we will process the refund within 48 hours. It's that simple â€“ your satisfaction is our priority."
    },
    {
      question: "Does the method work for twins?",
      answer: "Yes! We have a special section dedicated to twins and multiples. We know it's an even bigger challenge, so we've adapted the techniques for this specific reality. Many mums of twins have already succeeded with our method."
